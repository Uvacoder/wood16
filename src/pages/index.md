  title: Why Dave
  description: >
    Dave uses exotic wood from all over the world to achieve the color and design he is looking for. Each plank of wood is hand picked from local businesses in New Hampshire. Locally crafted, exquisitely finished, made with a soul.

  "Cutting boards, rolling pins, and segmented wood bowls are my specialty but I like doing something different, keep on the look out for new products." -Dave
